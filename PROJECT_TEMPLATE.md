Create an interactive educational website for a CNN MNIST classifier with these sections:

STRUCTURE:
1. Hero with animated title
2. Interactive CNN visualization showing convolution/pooling layers
3. Live demo where users can draw digits and see predictions
4. Embedded Jupyter notebook
5. Key concepts cards

STYLE:
- Modern blue gradient (#0066FF to #004DCC)
- Smooth animations
- Mobile responsive

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Use vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- Include the notebook using notebook.js
- Add play/pause controls for animations
- Create a canvas for digit drawing

Focus on making complex concepts simple so that anybody can understand proffesional or clueless through visual metaphors.



Also use the /Users/arielsoothy/PycharmProjects/Ariel/MetaOr/CNN/MNIST_with_CNN.ipynb for reference, 
and /Users/arielsoothy/PycharmProjects/Ariel/MetaOr/CNN/notebook-interactive.html as an example of how the notebook should look. the ineractivenotbok you make should be on the same page at the bottom, this is copied from anpther project, the content should be with the MNIST_with_CNN just we want the same format get me?

This hsa a git repo and a githubpages.

use best practice to build website ux/ui and infra and file structure wise, everything.
