Task: Develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Create a notebook that performs the following steps to achieve this:
1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. Define a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. Compile and train the CNN model on the training data.
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test data.
5. Visualize examples of predictions, including both correct and incorrect classifications.
