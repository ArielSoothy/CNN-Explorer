## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arielsoothy/PycharmProjects/Ariel/MetaOr/CNN
   ```

2. **Start the local server:**
   ```bash
   python3 serve.py
   ```
   Or specify a custom port:
   ```bash
   python3 serve.py --port 8080
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   The website will automatically open at `http://localhost:8000`

### Alternative Method

If you prefer not to use the Python server, you can:

1. **Open directly in browser:**
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   
2. **Or use any static file server:**
   ```bash
   # Using Node.js http-server
   npx http-server .
   
   # Using Python's built-in server
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
